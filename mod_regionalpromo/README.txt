Regional Promotions
Written by Frank Laszlo (frank@asmallorange.com)

DESCRIPTION
--------------------
This module will allow you to set regional restrictions on existing
promotion codes. You can set the promotions to only be valid for specific
cities, states, postal codes, or countries. All restrictions work with 
an "OR" method, meaning if any of the conditions are met, the coupon
is accepted. If none of the conditions are met, when the customer attempts
to checkout, they will be kicked back to the order page, presented with an
error, and the promotion code removed from their order.

INSTALLATION
--------------------
1) Copy all files into your whmcs installation directory
2) Navigate to Utilities -> Addon Modules -> Regional Promo and click "Install"
3) Start creating your restrictions!
